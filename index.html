It's a hobby that requires quick thinking, a lot of practice, patience, perseverance and creativity.
My main speedgame is <a href='https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_III' target='_blank'>Dark Souls III</a>.
I'm involved in the
community, and met in it a lot of nice people I like to call friends. I stream my attempts live over
<a href="http://twitch.tv/johndisandonato" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a>. I also enjoy developing 
mods and tools to both assist the speedrunning practice and make it more interesting and fun.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb's books inspired me to leverage the mathematical and statistical
techniques of quantitative finance and econometrics while being wary of relying too much
on non-provable models and theory. I extensively use <strong>Python</strong> with its data
science toolchain for backtesting trading strategies on equity and futures. I employ
<strong>C++</strong> when it is necessary to optimize execution speed. I'm interested in
studying <strong>deep learning</strong> techniques as I believe there is value yet
undiscovered in nonlinear optimization for financial applications.</p></section><section class="half"><h3>Computer science</h3><p>I think a scientific approach to software design is fundamental for achieving the best possible
results in terms of code correctness, mantainability and efficiency.
Moreover, relying upon academical findings and research can greatly aid in finding elegant 
solutions to complex problems.</p><p>This is one of the reasons I'm learning pure functional programming and
the <strong>Haskell</strong> language.</p><ul class="cloud"><li>Formal languages</li><li>Cellular automata</li><li>Fractals</li><li>Computability</li><li>Information theory</li><li>Artificial intelligence</li><li>Neural networks</li><li>Analysis of algorithms</li><li>Graphs and data structures</li><li>Signal processing</li><li>Digital image processing</li><li>Human computer interaction</li></ul></section><section class="half"><h3>Frontend Web Development</h3><p><strong>Javascript</strong> is the programming language I'm most proficient in.

in optimizing computationally intense algorithms, exploiting the latest web standards, implementing

code structure. My favorite tools for the job are <strong>Webpack</strong> and 
<strong>ESLint</strong>. The Javascript ecosystem has come a long way, and we finally get to have
sane, opinionated frameworks with all-encompassing toolchains. By far, my favorite is <strong>Vue.js</strong>.</p><ul class="cloud"><li>Javascript</li><li>HTML5</li><li>CSS3</li><li>Vue.js</li><li>D3.js</li><li>WebGL</li><li>Canvas</li><li>SVG</li></ul></section><section class="half"><h3>3D Graphics programming</h3><p>I study and work with 3D modeling and rendering algorithms.

p.
  I enjoy developing (and playing) videogames as I think this is one of the areas of computer programming that encompasses the widest range of knowledge domains, 
  where all the efforts and skills of a programmer are heavily tested and brought to their limit. I thus think programming a videogame to be one of the most rewarding
  challenges out there. Specifically, one of the most fascinating techniques is procedural content generation, which I employ extensively in my game programming
  process.--></article>
