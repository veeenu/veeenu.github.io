I have never been too good at graphicsy things. When I was 9 a teacher of mine gave me a bad mark for a drawing because it was "too childish". I also barely scraped by at art and technical drawing in the next few years, all the while achieving quite above average success in everything else - except PE of course, what were you thinking?<p>I started settling the PE thing a few years later when I began lifting weights for fun, and here I am some more years later trying to fix my other youthful mistakes.<p>I began working in 2011 for the Milan-based agency <a href=http://gwcworld.com/>GWC World</a> where I honed my skills in many aspects of web development - backend, frontend, system administration and the like. During 2013 I stopped working full-time with GWC to specialize in frontend development and to begin a consulting career, counting GWC and <a href=http://interfase.it/>Interfase</a> among my clients.<p>Working on complex, interactive web applications for fun and profit sparked my interest in, let's say, things that can be seen, and during early 2014 I decided to begin studying graphics programming.<p>At the time of writing this, I don't have any production code ready yet, but I've been working on a couple of very interesting projects with GWC (an SVG-based map drawing system) and Interfase (an ambient intelligence software prototype, featuring motion detection). Besides that, I've been working on a couple of trivial 3D projects, namely Manfr3Do® and an endless running first person zombie shooter game - I'll talk about those in a future post -, a procedurally generated 2D dungeon game and <a href=/data/render1.png>a</a> <a href=/data/render2.png>bunch</a> <a href=/data/render3.png>of</a> <a href=/data/render4.png>images</a> modeled and rendered with Blender (I actually just followed a couple of very well-made tutorials, I won't take credit for this :D).<p>I submitted an <a href=http://js1k.com/2014-dragons/demo/1910>entry to the JS1k WebGL compo</a>. It's not that impressive actually but I had my share of fun challenging myself to compress as much as possible the code that generates procedurally an infinite tube geometry, and I'll talk also about this as soon as I can.<p>Bye for now!</section></article><ul class=links><li><a href=https://github.com/veeenu target=_blank> <img alt=GitHub src=/img/github.svg> </a><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreavenuta/ target=_blank> <img alt=LinkedIn src=/img/linkedin.svg> </a><li><a href=https://twitter.com/johndisandonato target=_blank> <img alt=Twitter src=/img/twitter.svg> </a><li><a href=https://twitch.tv/johndisandonato target=_blank> <img alt=Twitch.tv src=/img/twitch.svg> </a><li><a href=cv.pdf target=_blank> <img alt="CV - Icon made by Vitaly Gorbachev (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/vitaly-gorbachev) from www.flaticon.com" src=/img/cv.svg> </a></ul></div><script async src=/katex.min.js></script><script data-cf-beacon='{"token": "9c82a3cc7db742e4bb18aebd57b40893"}' defer src=https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js></script>
