It refers to a code golfing challenge dating back in 1984, a few years before I was born. Its rules asked to build a raytracer in C with certain features and functions and shading models. Among those, Andrew Kensler's version, checking in at 1337 bytes, stood out and became world-wide renowned (for good reasons, if you ask me).

In this post I'm going to explain the concepts and my implementation for the <em>GPU matrix palette skinning</em> algorithm in WebGL. Skeletal animation is quite complex and I struggled to find a guide that explained clearly what was going on, or that didn't waste too much time around language-specifics or code engineering making it quite hard to connect the dots in a simple way, so I hope I can manage to keep it simple enough.</article><article><header><h4><a href=https://veeenu.github.io/blog/implementing-keyframe-animation/>Implementing Keyframe Animation</a><br></h4><small> <time>Tuesday, 22 Apr 2014</time> · <em> Reading time: 14 mins </em> </small><br></header><p>In this post I will show you the way I implemented a keyframe-based 3D real time animation using WebGL. Familiarity with the WebGL / OpenGL rendering pipeline, and with linear algebra is necessary.
