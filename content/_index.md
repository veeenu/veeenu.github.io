        <h1>Hello!</h1>

      <section>
        <p>I'm a software developer and quantitative analyst. I cultivate
        interest in a wide variety of topics related to programming, mathematics
        and finance.</p> <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in <a
        href="http://www.informatica.unifi.it" target="_blank">Computer
        Science</a>, with a thesis on <a href="/thesis-bsc.pdf"
        target="_blank">Procedural Content Generation and Real-time Rendering
        Techniques</a> and a Master of Science degree cum laude in <a
        href="http://www.frm.unifi.it" target="_blank">Finance and Risk
        Management</a>, with a thesis on <a href="/thesis-msc.pdf"
        target="_blank">Deep Learning Models for High-Frequency Cryptocurrency
        Forecasting</a>.</p> <p>When I'm not writing code for fun or profit, I
        enjoy <a target='_blank'
        href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun'>speedrunning
        videogames</a>. It's a hobby that requires quick thinking, a lot of
        practice, patience, perseverance and creativity. My main speedgame is <a
        href='https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_III' target='_blank'>Dark
        Souls III</a>. I'm involved in the community, and met in it a lot of nice
        people I like to call friends. I stream my attempts live over <a
        href="http://twitch.tv/johndisandonato" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a>. I
        also enjoy developing mods and tools to both assist the speedrunning
        practice and make it more interesting and fun. </p>

        <h3>Quantitative finance</h3>
        <p>I grew interested in financial markets and trading sometime before
        finishing my BSc. Nassim Nicholas Taleb's books inspired me to
        leverage the mathematical and statistical techniques of quantitative
        finance and econometrics while being wary of relying too much on
        non-provable models and theory. I extensively use
        <strong>Python</strong> with its data science toolchain for
        backtesting trading strategies on equity and futures. I employ
        <strong>Rust</strong> or <strong>C++</strong> when it is necessary to
        optimize execution speed. I'm interested in studying <strong>deep
        learning</strong> techniques as I believe there is value yet
        undiscovered in nonlinear optimization for financial
        applications.</p> <a href="/firm/QuantFinAndDer.pdf">Here</a> you can
        find the notes for the class in Quantitative Finance and Derivatives
        from the Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze, written by me and Amedeo
        Mela.</p>

          <h3>Computer science</h3>
          <p>I think a scientific approach to software design is
          fundamental for achieving the best possible results in terms of code
          correctness, mantainability and efficiency. Moreover, relying upon
          academical findings and research can greatly aid in finding elegant
          solutions to complex problems.</p><p>This is one of the reasons I'm
          learning pure functional programming and the <strong>Haskell</strong>
          language.</p>

        <h3>Frontend Web Development</h3>
        <p><strong>Javascript</strong> is the programming language I'm most
        proficient in. I have experience in optimizing computationally intense
        algorithms, exploiting the latest web standards, implementing graceful
        degradation and designing consistent, fault-tolerant, cross-browser
        behaviors.</p> <p>I tend to meticulously structure my workflows by
        employing standard tools and a sound, semantic code structure. My
        favorite tools for the job are <strong>Webpack</strong> and
        <strong>ESLint</strong>. The Javascript ecosystem has come a long way,
        and we finally get to have sane, opinionated frameworks with
        all-encompassing toolchains. By far, my favorite is
        <strong>Vue.js</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Graphics programming</h3>
        <p>I study and work with 3D modeling and rendering algorithms and image
        processing. I'm familiar with the OpenGL pipeline and various
        mathematical methods of describing and rendering geometry. On occasion I
        like to write about them in my <a href='/blog'>blog</a>.</p>
