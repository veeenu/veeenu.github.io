I started this blog because I recently stumbled across the 
beautiful world of graphics programming, and thought that
maybe for once sharing my learning process could be useful
to somebody, somewhere in the world.

Preface. I have never been too good at graphicsy things.
When I was 9 a teacher of mine gave me a bad mark for a
drawing because it was "too childish". I also barely
scraped by at art and technical drawing in the next few
years, all the while achieving quite above average success
in everything else - except PE of course, what were you
thinking?

I started settling the PE thing a few years later when I
began lifting weights for fun, and here I am some more
years later trying to fix my other youthful mistakes.

I began working in 2011 for the Milan-based agency
[GWC World][gwcworld] where I honed my skills in many
aspects of web development - backend, frontend, system
administration and the like. During 2013 I stopped
working full-time with GWC to specialize in frontend
development and to begin a consulting career, counting
GWC and [Interfase][interfase] among my clients.

Working on complex, interactive web applications for
fun and profit sparked my interest in, let's say, things
that can be seen, and during early 2014 I decided to begin
studying graphics programming.

At the time of writing this, I don't have any production
code ready yet, but I've been working on a couple of
very interesting projects with GWC (an SVG-based map drawing
system) and Interfase (an ambient intelligence software
prototype, featuring motion detection). Besides that, I've
been working on a couple of trivial 3D projects, namely
Manfr3Do&reg; and an endless running first person zombie
shooter game - I'll talk about those in a future post -,
a procedurally generated 2D dungeon game and [a][render1]
[bunch][render2] [of][render3] [images][render4] modeled
and rendered with Blender (I actually just followed a
couple of very well-made tutorials, I won't take credit
for this :D).

I submitted an [entry to the JS1k WebGL compo][js1kdemo].
It's not that impressive actually but I had my share of fun
challenging myself to compress as much as possible the
code that generates procedurally an infinite tube geometry,
and I'll talk also about this as soon as I can.

Bye for now!
